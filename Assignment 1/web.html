						<h1>Interest in IT</h1>
					</div>
					<div class="sectionContent">
						<p>My Interests in IT are within internet services, specifically the networks which provide them.
							 Australia is renowned for being a developed country with internet connectivity and speeds which
							 perform well below the levels of other developed countries. Growing up I remember having to keep
							 my playstation on over the weekend to download NBA 2k via my wifi connection. To combat this I
							 researched possible solutions to the problem which resulted in me running an ethernet cable the
							 length of my house much to my mothers dismay.</p>

						<p>I chose to come to RMIT because it was one of the only universities which allowed me to study Computer
							and Networks  engineering. The reason I choose this course is because it gives me a happy medium between
							studying both the software and hardware areas in IT. I currently have no proffesional experience working in
							IT however In my studies I would like to learn specifically how internet networks work and operate and
							specifically I want to be able to design and build networks to service both and maintain enterprises
							and personal areas. Specifically I wish to be well versed in both cisco and juniper systems and to implement
							and operate said systems.</p>

								<h2>Myers Briggs Type Indicator</h2>
								<p><img src="16pers.png" alt="MBTI Results" /></p>
								<p><a href="https://www.16personalities.com/">The Myers Brigg Personality Test</a> shows that I have an Assertive Executive (ESTJ-A) personality. ESTJ personality
									types are generally people who lead and can be described as logical thinkers who like things to be ordered, structured
									and run by the book. This personality trait is usually associated with being traditional, self confident, practical
									and having strong leadership skills, However they tend to be insensitive, inflexible and argumentative.</p>
									<p>I do agree with the test that I am a natural leader however with these factors considered I will aim to make sure
										that I make an effort to understand the point of view of people that I may not agree with and try to keep flexible
										in accordance with my teammates.</p>

								<h2>Learning Style Test</h2>
								<p><img src="learn.png" alt="Learning Test Results" /></p>
								<p class="subDetails">Learning Preferences</p>
								<p>From <a href="http://www.educationplanner.org/students/self-assessments/learning-styles.shtml">The Learning Test</a>The Learning Test it was revealed that I am an Auditory and Tactile learner.
									Auditory learners learn better by hearing content, they are more likely to consume and understand information that they hear and often speak concepts out loud
									to understand them. Being an auditory learner I should aim to be seated nearer to the teacher so I can hear and in study read my notes out loud to better aid in
									my understanding.</p>
								<p>Tactile learners generally learn with a hands on approach. They learn better in environments where they are performing tasks  and/or performing a physical activity
									and need to keep active, often having difficulties staying still. With these learning styles a potential technique I could use to study could be to record notes to
									listen to when I go for runs and walks. This will combine both the strengths of the Tactile and auditory learning styles to improve my study. </p>

								<h2>Test Three</h2>
									<p><img src="last.png" alt="IPIP Big Five Factor Markers" /></p>
									<p class="subDetails">Big 5 Factors</p>
									<p>For the last test I conducted a <a href="http://openpsychometrics.org/tests/IPIP-BFFM/"> IPIP Big-Five Factor Markers</a> personality test. This test measures your personality with the big 5 personality
										traits of Extroversion, Smotinal Stability, Agreeableness, Conscientiosness and Imagination. The test uses statements where the participant has to use a point scale to show wether the agree or disagree
									  with. My results with this show a lower level of extroversion meaning that I am less outgoing and social. High score in emotional stability, Mid level Agreeableness and lower scores in Conscientiosness and Imagination.
									  With these results like the MBTI test it showed that I am more conventional and traditional something which I will have to improve on in order to have a succesful in IT I will need to be more open to change in a
									 	field where things are chamging all the time.</p>

					<h1>Project Idea</h1>
				</div>

				<div class="grid-container">
				  <div class="item1">
						<h2>Overview</h2>
						<p>The Pocket Caddie  is a combination of software and hardware solution which will allow for golfers to get real time accurate yardages allowing them to navigate the golf course with ease. The app will work with the use of
							an app by the golfer and a set of beacons and sensors which are set up by the golf course which will provide a better representation of the real time course conditions and yardages for golfers. As well as yardages the app
							will incorporate weather data which is readily available to help inform golfers to make informed decisions on the course, providing a personal caddie at the touch of a button. </p>
					</div>

					<div class="item2">
						<h2>Motivation</h2>
						<p>The Golf Club Participation report in 2020-21 reported that 1.2 million golfers played rounds of golf in Australia alone which is a 6.4% increase over previous years. In the game of golf one of the biggest aspects of the
							game is distance. Knowing how far away you are from the hole and certain hazards is an essential aspect of the game. </p>
						<p>Current technologies such gps golf apps such as Golfshot and Arcoss have a level of inaccuracy and rely on greens keepers who work the course to constantly update different locations as they change the pin and hole locations,
							which they often don’t do. The Range finders which exist currently use laser technologies to get pinpoint readings, but are often awkward to carry in your pocket, are quite expensive (almost $400+ for good quality) and can often
							decrease the speed of play, which is a big factor driving people away from the game. </p>
					</div>

				  <div class="item3">
						<h2>Tools and Technologies</h2>
						<p>For the locational data I purpose the use of beacons which will ping off the users device. With these pings the app will be able to determine the distance it is from each beacon. These beacons should be durable with long battery
							lives and will need to be able to withstand rain and high impact. For the creation of the app Node-Red can be used to create a user interface that users can use. Node-Red is a web app which uses flows to create applications, these
							flows have a variety of text editors which allow for implementations of various code. It is also built on Node.js which is why I choose it as it will allow for it to run seamlessly with the beacons and other low cost hardware which
							it might use. </p>
						<p>To be able to create a finished product I will need to be able to design and create an app that is able to pick up a signal from a beacon and determine the distance between the device and the beacon. The spp will also be to display
							an image of the hole and provide a live update on location. The app builder will require an understanding of how to work with hardware in realtime and be able to create code which is able to process data almost straight away. </p>
						</div>
				</div>
					<article>
						<h2>Description</h2>
						<p>The Pocket Caddie will be a two part hardware and software solution which will provide golfers with distances on the golf course as well as suggestions on clubs and real time weather data to help golfers make informed decisions
							as they would when they are playing with a caddie. </p>
						<p>For the hardware set up Golf Courses will be required to install beacons at the next to or in hazards as shown by the red markings on the image and attach one on to the flag stick as shown by the blue dot, these beacons will
							be used to help the application measure the distance it is from said beacons. These devices will have tags assigned to them which will help assign them to a hole, this will ensure any beacon readings which aren’t on the whole the
							 user is playing will be ignored. The only other thing that will be required by the course is to set the compass direction from each tee box to the hole that will assist with the wind measurements which the app will use.</p>
						<img src="golf.png"  alt="Golf Hole" class="center">
						<p>This hardware will be accompanied by an app which can be installed on the player's phone. The basic functionality of this app will provide a birds eye view of the hole as well as the yardage from your location to the pin,
							in addition to this icons will be placed on the hazards which will allow for users to to view the yardage by clicking on the icon, this will ensure the user interface remains uncluttered and only relevant information is displayed.
							This app will also have additional features which include a club recommendation function, with this function users will be able input the data for how long they hit each club. The club length data will then be combined with data
							obtained from wind readings nearby from weather stations, combining this data will allow for the app to calculate a distance which the ball will need to travel and provide a club recommendation based on the data the player provided.
							As is standard in most of the competition in the market the app will also include a scorecard function which will allow for golfers to record scores and other statistics such as if they hit the fairway, which direction they missed and
							how many putts it took them.
						</p>
						<p>While I believe this project will be successful, considerations will have to be made to ensure the success of the project. From a business standpoint the demographic of golfers is generally older people who might not like the technology
							and find it hard to use. To combat this we  will have to implement features such as a quick round start which will allow users to quickly start a round through the tap of a button when they reach the course. This can be done by a beacon at
							the clubhouse which once your device pings it, it will push a notification to the phone to start a round. Another Consideration that will need to be taken into account is the resilience of the beacons, these beacons will be placed outdoors
							and will need to to be able to withstand the impact of a ball if they are hit, the beacons which are used will need to be durable and be able to withstand weather conditions which they will experience being left outdoors. </p>
					</article>
						<h2>Outcome</h2>
						<p>With the use of beacons instead of gps The PocketCaddie will fill the gap left by existing products providing a much more accurate and comprehensive data set when compared to gps apps which require golf courses to manually update there
							layouts online, which they rarely do and a much cheaper and convenient alternative than range finders. This product will allow for players to seem as if they are playing alongside a professional caddie like the pros by using a club recommendation
							feature to assist players with their game. This product will be easy to implement by courses and even easier for players to use and will give everything a player needs in the palm of their hands. </p>
